Title: هلليلوا للرب خلاصي - انجليزي
Capo: 0

[Chorus]
هللوا للرب خلاصي، هو نوري ماذا أخاف 
الرب الإله قوتي وفرحي قد أصبح قرن خلاصي

[Chorus]
Behold God is my salvation 
I will trust and will not be afraid

[Verse 1]
For the Lord my God is my strength and my song 
He also has become my salvation

[Verse 2]
With joy I drink the living water 
From a well that never can run dry

[Verse 3]
For the Lord my God is my strength and my song
He also has become my salvation
